# 🏦 Simple Banking System

This is a small beginner project I built while learning Python.

It’s a simple text-based banking system where you can:
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Check your balance
- Quit the program

Starting balance is 1000.

I made this project to practice conditionals, loops, and basic input handling in Python.

## 💡 How to run

This project is one of my early practice programs.
